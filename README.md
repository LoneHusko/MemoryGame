# THE ULTIMATE EPIC MEMORY GAME!!!!11!!

After starting the application please select a difficulty level from the dropdown unless the game cannot be started.
After start a grid will appear on the right (the size of which depends on the difficulty you selected). Then they will
start flashing sequentially. You have to remember the pattern and then click the buttons in the same order.

Good luck!
